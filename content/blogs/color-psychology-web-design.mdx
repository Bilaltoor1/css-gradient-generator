### 4. Test and Optimize

Always test your color choices:

- **Gather user feedback**
- **Analyze heatmaps and user behavior**

## Common Color Psychology Mistakes

### 1. Using Too Many Colors
Limit your palette to 2-3 primary colors plus neutrals to avoid overwhelming users.

Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for readability:

While trends are important, your brand identity and user needs should take priority.

The same color can have different meanings in different contexts within your site.
